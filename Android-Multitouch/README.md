# Exercise 1
 Drawing a straight line (with one finger, when lifting the finger the drawn line disappears).
# Exercise 2
Drawing of many straight lines (with one finger, when lifting the finger the line remains drawn).
# Exercise 3
Parallel drawing of many curved lines (with several fingers, when lifting a finger its corresponding line disappears).
# Exercise 4
Drawing of an orientation vector from 3 points (3 contacts) describing an isosceles triangle.
# Exercise 5
Scaling and dragging of squares drawn on the screen. Double click on the screen to draw a square. The square can be moved with one finger on the screen and scaled with two fingers.
# Exercise 6
Exercise 6 is a mini-game application in which several figures appear on the screen and the user has to scale them (making them bigger or smaller). 
on the screen and the user has to scale them (making them bigger or smaller) to make them smaller than theto make them smaller than the reference figures (these are different from the normal ones because their color is black). from the normal ones because their color is black).This type of games are used for children to learn basedon the game, and this type of block game improves the children's and this type of block game improves reasoning and problem-solving skills.

The application will put these figures randomly on the screen and furthermore, if the user double taps he will be able to create more random shapes of random sizes on the screen of random sizes on the screen. When the user succeeds in placing a figure "inside" the reference figure, a "click" sound will be heard.

The game will restart again when the user gets a "success" sound, and once all the figures are placed in the "holes", the game will restart again.
